/*
The integer entered by the user is stored in variable n. Then the while loop is iterated until the test expression n != 0 is evaluated to 0 (false).

After first iteration, the value of n will be 345 and the count is incremented to 1.
After second iteration, the value of n will be 34 and the count is incremented to 2.
After third iteration, the value of n will be 3 and the count is incremented to 3.
At the start of fourth iteration, the value of n will be 0 and the loop is terminated.
